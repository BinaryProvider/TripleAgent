# TripleAgent

TripleAgent is an open source help agent control, with the purpose to display/animate a sprite with an associated label on a Windows Form. The control can be used to present important information in a fun way. Inspiration has been taken from the old Microsoft Agents (Clippy, Merlin, Rover, etc.).
